# Portfolio Website
  This is a repo containing my personal portfolio website. I am creating it as a way to showcase my skills to potential employers.
I am using a few frameworks to help with laying out elements, Twitter's bootstrap mainly. Css is not my expertise. But as you will see if you go to the website I am not terrible with it. I also used jQuery to create the sticky nav effect.
